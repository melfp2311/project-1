This is Jimmys, Andrea and Mel's class project.

 Surviving the quarantine

3 out of 3 adults have felt bored and/or overwhelmed during quarantine
These are hard times for everyone
Most of us have stuff and work things to do from 9 to 5. 
We are sharing - possibly excessively - with our families and sometimes we don't know what to do with all this new free time.
And there is just so much content out there
Should we be doing something different anyway? 
There's a lot going on everywhere, and the pressure and expectations of what we should be doing with free time could sometimes be overwhelming.

The concept

All the fun
We wanted to create something fun to work on that had no other goal than to distract friends and family from quarantine and provide selected random options for some common needs and activities during the lockdown.
In a world of content overexposure, selectivity -or randomness- is highly appreciated.

...and some of the work
Drinkers, movie fans and twitter poets, we've got you covered.
We decided to added the 9 to 5 part for people who wanted to feel a little more in control, but it doesn't necessarily have to be work related.

USER STORIES

"As an employee working from home I want to keep track of my daily goals so that I know what I'm attaining each day."
- Bob, the 9 to 5

"As a person with more free time I want to get random recommendations so that I can discover new movies."
- Ana, the movie fan

"Aa a person staying at home all day I want to get a random cocktail recipe so that I can drink starting noon."
-The all of us

Tasks and roles
We worked on each html file with their own script and css files.
Used Mural to assign tasks and deadlines. Daily team check in's on Slack, Whatsapp and Zoom calls.
Jimmy was in charge of general styling, color backgrounds, header, footer, etc. Andrea spent more time on connecting and retrieving information from the APIs.
Mel unify CSS files and made sure mobile responsiveness was ok.
   
   CHALLENGES
Navigating through the Apiâ€™s to get the items the we needed.
CSS and mobile responsiveness was hard. Really hard.
Uploading to Github: local branches, merge and pull requests conflicts Things we thought were quick fixes prove to be very time consuming.

 SUCCESESS
We effectively managed our time to finish every task on time. Worked good as a team.
Over communicating at all times. Slack, slack, slack.
Materialize as CSS framework was easy.

Instructions for future development

Short term
Unify design and UX/UI.
If possible, leave just one css and one script files for all the application.
Buy domain.

Mid term
Add input on drinks page so users can get a drink from the ingredients they actually have at hand or simply prefer.
